# ServiceTalk Examples

These examples are meant to demonstrate gradle and maven build file
configuration outside of the ServiceTalk project. For a full set of
examples see the
[ServiceTalk Repo](https://github.com/apple/servicetalk/tree/main/servicetalk-examples).

This project uses gradle to build and includes a pom.xml in the gRPC
helloworld example to demo how the ServiceTalk gRPC code generation
maven integration works.
